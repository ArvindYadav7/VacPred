# VacPred
VacPred software is a machine-learning based package for prediction of Plant Vacuolar proteins. Users have to provide the single or multiple protein sequence in fasta format and the software based on our model will predict the plant vacuole protein. This software could be used to fast and accurate prediction of plant vacuolar proteins with high speed and without any specific need of software installation.
# Dependency
Users must have to install the perl either of 32bits or 64bits from the link https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/.
# Installation
1.	Download VacPred by
git clone https://github.com/ArvindYadav7/VacPred 

2.	Unzip the download folder of VacPred
3.	Double click on Setup to install VacPred 
# Input File
User must have to select the input fasta file of protein sequence (not DNA/RNA) or K-PSSM calculated CSV file from the main menu File tab. The fasta may have one or more sequences in standard fasta format.
        
1. Please remember that your fasta header does not contain any blank space.
2. Fasta file should not contain any empty line.
# Output File
Program will save result in CSV file format. Result contains the protein class with probability level and prediction score.
# Datasets
All datasets can be downloaded from: http://deepaklab.com/vacpred/
