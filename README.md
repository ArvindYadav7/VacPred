# VacPred
VacPred software is a machine-learning based package for the prediction of Plant Vacuolar proteins. Users have to provide a single or multiple protein sequence in fasta format and the software based on our model will predict the plant vacuole protein. This software could be used for fast and accurate prediction of plant vacuolar proteins with high speed and without any specific need of software installation.
# Dependency
Users must install the Perl 32bits or 64bits using the link https://www.activestate.com/products/perl/.
# Installation
1.	Download VacPred by
        http://45.248.163.59/bic/vacpred.php 

2.	Unzip the download folder of VacPred
3.	Double-click on Setup to install VacPred 
# Input File
Users must select the input fasta protein sequence file (not DNA/RNA) or K-PSSM calculated CSV file from the menu File tab. The fasta may have one or more sequences in standard fasta format.
        
1. Please remember that your Fasta header contains no blank space.
2. The Fasta file should not contain any empty lines.
# Output File
The program will save the result in CSV file format. The result includes the protein class with probability level and prediction score.
# Datasets
All datasets can be downloaded from: http://45.248.163.59/bic/vacpred.php
